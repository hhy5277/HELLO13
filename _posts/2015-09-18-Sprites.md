While working with one large project, my colleague and I were thinking about how to automate building the CSS sprites. Before, we used to build them manually or with different online services which anyway took a lot of time. Also, by that time we already used Gulp to build the project and so were looking for a gulp-friendly solution for sprites.

There're  different variants:

* [css-sprite](https://www.npmjs.org/package/css-sprite)
* [gulp-sprite-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sprite-generator)
* [gulp-spritesmith](https://github.com/Otouto/gulp-spritesmith)
* [gulp.spritesmith](https://github.com/twolfson/gulp.spritesmith)

Eventually we chose [gulp.spritesmith](https://github.com/twolfson/gulp.spritesmith) as an official port of it, because of few dependencies.


Installlation
-------------

The first think to do is to install Gulp. Its official [Docs](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#getting-started) will help you a lot.
Then install gulp.spritesmith. If your project is empty yet (as mine is), take supplement packages as well:

> npm install gulp.spritesmith --save-dev

Now you can move to tuning the generator.


Tuning
------

The simpliest task would look like the following:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
gulp.task('sprite', function() {
    var spriteOutput =
        gulp.src("static/img/icon/*.png")
            .pipe(sprite({
                imgName: "sprite.png",
                cssName: "sprite.css",
                imgPath: "/static/img/sprite.png"
            }));

    spriteOutput.css.pipe(gulp.dest("static/css"));
    spriteOutput.img.pipe(gulp.dest("static/img"));
});
{% endhighlight%}

With that we can generate this sprite:

![img](/static/img/sprite.png)

It is served with the following CSS code:

{% highlight css linenos %}
/*
Icon classes can be used entirely standalone. They are named after their original file names.

```html
<!-- `display: block` sprite -->
<div class="icon-home"></div>

<!-- `display: inline-block` sprite -->
<img class="icon-home" />
```
*/
.icon-article {
  background-image: url(/static/img/sprite.png);
  background-position: -92px 0px;
  width: 92px;
  height: 92px;
}
.icon-briefcase {
  background-image: url(/static/img/sprite.png);
  background-position: -276px -92px;
  width: 92px;
  height: 92px;
}
...
{% endhighlight%}
