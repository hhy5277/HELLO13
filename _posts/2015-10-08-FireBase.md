For a long time, as a FE, all my projects are based on github page, which doesn't power backend. I had to host a extra [VPS](http://market.aliyun.com/products/55528001/jxsc000031.html?spm=5176.900004.4.2.NbHfQP) for supporting my site, especially data storage util I find that the [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/features.html) is a good choice.

Firebase can power app's backend, including data storage, user authentication, static hosting, and more, which help us improve extraordinary user experiences.

Overview
--------

Data in your Firebase database is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. When you build cross-platform apps with our [Android](https://www.firebase.com/docs/android/), [iOS](https://www.firebase.com/docs/ios/), and [JavaScript](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/) SDKs, all of your clients share one Firebase database and automatically receive updates with the newest data.

Install
-------

You'll need to include the Firebase JavaScript client library in your website. Simply add a script tag to the `<head>` section of your HTML file and recommend including the library directly from our CDN:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<script src="https://cdn.firebase.com/js/client/2.3.1/firebase.js"></script>
{% endhighlight%}

Alternatively, if you prefer to install Firebase as a local application dependency, you can use Bower:

> bower install firebase

The Firebase JavaScript API and the Firebase Node.js API are exactly the same. Firebase clients run just as easily on your servers as they do on end-user devices. We offer a Node.js module which can be installed via npm from the command line:

> npm install firebase --save

To use the Firebase Node.js module in your application, just require the Firebase client library.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var Firebase = require("firebase");
{% endhighlight%}

Usage
-----

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// Create a connection to your Firebase database
var ref = new Firebase("https://<YOUR-FIREBASE-APP>.firebaseio.com");

// Save data
ref.set({ name: "有田十三" });

// Listen for realtime changes
ref.on("value", function(data) {
  var name = data.val().name;
  alert("My name is " + name);
});
{% endhighlight%}

Now, I can manage data online without DBMS like below:

Nice cool, right?
