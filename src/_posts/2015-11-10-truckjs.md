Front-End Engineering(FEE) is an engineering design approach used to control project expenses and improve work flow efficiency, focuses on technical requirements.
For better realizing TruckJS, the tool of Meituan resolving FEE, I tried to use TruckJS here for optimization.

Here's a series of posts to describe the optimization:

1. Module with TruckJS
2. [Cache Management](/posts/localstorage/)
3. [Combo Server](/posts/combo/)

## Module loader

In its narrower sense, TruckJS is a JavaScript file and module loader, like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/). Using a modular script loader will improve the speed and quality of your code.


#### Define before Execute

1. set `requires.config` and `require()` in head
2. use `require(module, callback)` in foot, `requirejs.__require.push(args)`
3. execute `callback` when truckjs loaded
{% highlight html linenos %}
<script>
    var requirejs = {
        __require: [],
        __requirejsConfig: {
            baseUrl: 'http://localhost:4000',
            prefix: '/static/js/'
        }
    }, require = function() {
        requirejs.__require.push(arguments)
    };
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

#### Algorithm of Resolving Deps

Build the deps topology(Directed Acyclic Graph) from `__denpendencies[]` and get topological order, then `depending()`.

Start from root(the page as root):

1. `depending()`: make sure that this module isn't `executed()`，and has `__denpendencies[]`，otherwise `ready()`, `executing()`, `executed()` directly
2. `loadModules()`: load modules of `__denpendencies[0]` first always
3. `loading()`: if this module has been stored in localStorage
4. If stored, `loaded()` and get its `__denpendencies[]`, continue to `depending()`
5. Otherwise, merged and sent request to get code to `eval()`, continue to step 4

Repeat step 1 to 5, util every `__denpendencies[]` all `executed()`.
